# Lotto tips

The aim of this program is to pull out 6 random unique numbers from one to 45.

## Instructions

This program should create a certain amount of combinations
that consists of 6 randomly generated numbers in the
range of 1 - 45(inclusive).  In order to determine the
number of lottery tips, we use the current time in
milliseconds when the program starts. The sum of the
digits in milliseconds is intended to determine the
number of lottery tickets desired. This means that the program
generates different number of tips and different numbers in the
tips on each run.

## Installation and environment

This is a Java program which requires an IDE like Intellij,
Eclipse etc. in order to be able to run the program.

## How to Run the Project

Just click on run in the upper part of IntelliJ.
The program runs without further inputs and no user interaction
is required. It takes the sum of the digits of the current
time in milliseconds on the computer it's been used on
and that is the exact number of random combinations that
the program generates. Each combination consists of 6 unique
digits (each can appear only once).
After all combinations are generated the program ends.
