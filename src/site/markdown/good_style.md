# Good style (good git commit messages and source code comments)

## With good git comments usage of git log (and other) make sense

### The seven rules of a great git commit message  

1. Separate the subject line from body with a blank line.  
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters.  
3. Capitalize the subject line.  
4. Do not end the subject line with a period.  
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line.  
6. Manually wrap each line of the body at 72 characters.  
7. Use the body to explain what and why instead of how.  


### Best practices for writing good comments  

1. Comments should not duplicate the code.  
2. Good comments do not excuse unclear code.  
3. If you canâ€™t write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.  
4. Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it.  
5. Explain unidiomatic code in comments.  
6. Provide links to the original source of copied code.  
7. Include links to external references where they will be most helpful.  
8. Add comments when fixing bugs.  
9. Use comments to mark incomplete implementations.
